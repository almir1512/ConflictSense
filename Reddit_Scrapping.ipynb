If you don't know where it is, it is the upside-down \\\"L\\\" shape area shaded with \\\"no data\\\" on every map.  Most of the world seems to be ignoring this area choosing instead to focus more on the surrounding nations like Mali and Niger, but this war is beginning to become quite consequential and outside players are beginning to get involved. \\n\\nI sat down with a panel of experts this week to talk about what is going on in Western Sahara, and what lies ahead for the state. On the panel this week was. \\n\\nSTEPHEN ZUNES > (Author/Cornell University)  \\nRICCARDO FABIANI > (International Crisis Group)  \\nJALEL HARCHAOUI > (Global Initiative)\\n\\nTo vastly oversimplify Western Sahara was once a colony of Imperial Spain, rich in Oil and Phosphates. The countries main people were the semi-nomadic Sahwari tribe who had lived in the area for years under Spanish rule, but with Franco dying the Spanish began to abandon the area as the Oil deposits there weren't very profitable with Libya pumping out so much of it at the time.\\n\\nLike many African nations the territory was supposed to have a vote on their future, to either become independent or be absorbed into neighboring Morocco or Mauritania. This vote never took place though as tens of thousands of Moroccans accompanied by the Moroccan army marched South into Western Sahara in what became known as \\\"The Green March\\\", with Rabat occupying most of the main towns and cities. Rabat was given the rights by Madrid to administer the area until a referendum could be held, but once again that vote never came. \\n\\nWhen it became obvious that Morocco would not ever allow a vote on the issue a 16-year bloody civil war between Morocco and the Polisario Front (being supported with Russian weapons given to them by Algeria) broke out. At the time the US feared the Polisario front was too closely tied with leftist nations, and worried that if they won the war they may support the Soviets, so the US gave funding and weapons to the Moroccan king in the hope he would finish the war. The fighting finally died down in 1991 with Morocco in control of 90% of Western Sahara and the Polisario front owning 10% of the barren desert on the very eastern edge of the country. The Polisario leadership left the country and set up in Tindouf, a small town on the very south-western edge of the Algerian desert. \\n\\nThis has been the situation for a long time now with much of the African union supporting the Sahwaris, and the French and Gulf States siding with Morocco, but the conflict continued to just simmer away. Recent leadership in Morocco is looking to solve the conflict once and for all now though, and put an end to the war. They are doing this by stepping up construction on a massive highway through Sahwari territory (in the hope of connecting West African states to the Moroccan ports), and beginning bombing and clearing operations in the southern areas controlled by the Sahwaris. \\n\\nThe major change though is with the international community getting involved more openly than ever before. The Israelis and Turks have begun to supply drones to the Moroccans, the French are supplying intelligence and the US in the final days of the Trump presidency gave full recognition to Morocco's claim over the entire area. \\n\\nMorocco has been an important partner for the US and Europe for decades now, both fighting with the US in the \\\"War on Terror\\\" and keeping a lid on the refugee situation just 15km to the South of Spain. Washingtons hope in supporting Morocco is that they build this region improving highway down the West coast of Africa, and that the King can remain popular, as there have been genuine fears in Paris that if Morocco were to lose this war the people may turn against the Moroccan royalty and the US/EU would lose one on their most important African partners. \\n\\nThe Wests support though of Morrocco raises an interesting question, can borders be changed by force? When nations like Saddam's Iraq have moved into other countries they have been met with international push back, but this conflict seems to be flying under the radar. The sources we spoke to all indicated that if a referendum were to be held today Western Sahara would vote almost certainly for independence and become the \\\"Sahwari Arab Democratic Republic\\\", which is why Morocco will always refuse to let an official referendum take place. In some terms this action by Rabat seems to be very close to an occupation in all but name, and the current state of affairs has the approval of everyone from Paris to Washington. \\n\\nOutside parties would argue that Morocco has bought stability to the region, and overall the West African area will be economically better off under the current situation, but that all comes at the direct expense of the Sahwari people who are currently fighting and dying in big numbers. \\n\\nI ask the question though of this group, what is the best option? Should there be a referendum for the Sahwari people to determine their own fate, or is the stability of the Moroccan government and the building of the West African highway more important than that? I would love to get your thoughts and comments on it. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou can check out the full discussion we had on this issue here on any of the links below.   \\n\\n\\nWEBSITE >> [https://www.theredlinepodcast.com/post/episode-42-western-sahara](https://www.theredlinepodcast.com/post/episode-42-western-sahara)  \\n\\n\\nAPPLE >> [https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/42-the-battle-for-western-sahara-africas-last-colony/id1482715810?i=1000519752289](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/42-the-battle-for-western-sahara-africas-last-colony/id1482715810?i=1000519752289)  \\n\\n\\nSPOTIFY >> [https://open.spotify.com/episode/2XTx1e2FZZpPISi2NMxovZ?si=6P1ET3ulQBGY5gPdsrLruw](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2XTx1e2FZZpPISi2NMxovZ?si=6P1ET3ulQBGY5gPdsrLruw)  \\n\\n\\nGOOGLE >> [https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVyZWRsaW5lLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz/episode/OTU2NTBlNTYtZDBlMS00ODA4LWE0MzMtOTQxZGRkYmYyOWNj?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJ66Lh17LwAhUQmp4KHctBD3QQkfYCegQIARAF](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVyZWRsaW5lLmxpYnN5bi5jb20vcnNz/episode/OTU2NTBlNTYtZDBlMS00ODA4LWE0MzMtOTQxZGRkYmYyOWNj?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiJ66Lh17LwAhUQmp4KHctBD3QQkfYCegQIARAF)  \\n\\n\\nYOUTUBE >> [https://youtu.be/ymGvtiP9UY8](https://youtu.be/ymGvtiP9UY8)\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 540,\n        \"min\": 519,\n        \"max\": 14273,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 549,\n        \"samples\": [\n          969\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 997,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[{'comment_body': 'Just to clarify, the article talks about a General Assembly resolution, so it could not be vetoed -the body in which the P5 have veto power is the Security Council', 'comment_score': 22}, {'comment_body': 'On Monday, US, UK and Canada imposed new sanctions on 9 officials, \\\\'key members of Myanmar\\\\'s military government, including the governor of the central bank and the chairman of the military-appointed electoral body, the Union Election Commission.\\\\'\\\\n\\\\n>Canada said it imposed additional sanctions on individuals and entities tied to the Myanmar armed forces, while Britain announced sanctions against state-owned enterprise Myanmar Gems Enterprise which was included in previous U.S. sanctions.\\\\n\\\\nUN postponed the vote today, possibly not feeling ready or waiting on ASEAN to garner optimal support, which seems it has not had or have currently. \\\\'Some diplomats said it had been delayed in a bid to win more support.\\\\' Currently\\\\n\\\\nThe details and terms, actions of the draft resolution includes a visit by UN special envoy to Myanmar for potential negotiation and further action in a plan created by ASEAN:\\\\n\\\\n>If adopted, the draft resolution would urge the military to allow a visit by the U.N. special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, and implement a plan by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to end the crisis.  \\\\n>  \\\\n>When President Joko \\u201cJokowi\\u201d Widodo and five other ASEAN leaders met with Myanmar\\u2019s junta leader Gen.

At the time I was a producer for Mattel, and we made a video game based on his television game show, \\\"1 vs 100.\\\" This particular recreation of the game called for a cast of 100 extras, and I would be in full control of them, the crew, a studio audience, and Bob. It was without a doubt the most ambitious shoot of my life.\\\\n\\\\nI was fucking terrified.\\\\n\\\\nNow, traditionally, actors are under studio contract to do merchandising gigs like these\\u2014which are often unpaid. As such, a lot of the time the talent is grumpy, hostile, and in a rush to get the job done as quickly as possible. A \\\"phoned in\\\" a performance was often the best case scenario, as opposed to a no-show or annoyed performer having to work on their day off. \\\\n\\\\nWe had booked Bob for four hours of work that day. He gave us ten. \\\\n\\\\nFrom the first moment, he treated me with such generosity and kindness that I\\\\'m tearing up thinking about it. \\\"I\\\\'m all yours today,\\\" he said while shaking my hand. \\\"Anything you need, just ask and I\\\\'ll make it happen. From this moment forward, I\\\\'m your talking prop.\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe man was a machine. He never took a break, never stopped improvising, and he constantly entertained the extras between shots. He would do multiple takes on everything, knowing it would get funnier each time. \\\"Let\\\\'s try it again, just for shiggles,\\\" he\\\\'d say (shits and giggles). And it always got funnier.\\\\n\\\\nLike the time we had to shoot the game\\\\'s ending, when the contestant (the game player) won the million dollar prize. \\\"What do you want to happen?\\\" he asked me. I was like, \\\"Well, what normally happens on the set?\\\" He laughed and said, \\\"Dude, I\\u2019ve seen the statistics. No one\\u2018s ever winning the million dollars. The odds are so astronomically low, we haven\\u2019t even rehearsed what would happen. So let\\\\'s make it up!\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAnd we did! We created a setup with the stage managers, lighting technicians, and camera operators on the fly. And on the first take\\u2014the big moment!\\u2014he comes out with, \\\"You did it! You won a million dollars! A million dollars of fake money! One MILLION FAKE DOLLARS! What fake stuff are you going to buy with your fake money?!?!\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSuffice to say, the laughs were so big from the 100 extras that the take was ruined, and we had to try again... several times. \\\\n\\\\nI\\u2019m so appreciative of him. He empowered me\\u2014a total stranger\\u2014trusted me, and gave me the confidence to shoot the hell out of that game. He\\u2019ll never know it, but that was a breakthrough moment for me, a moment where I felt valid, legitimate, and that Hollywood royality was no longer untouchable... they were now colleagues. From that day forward, imposter syndrome was a thing of the past.\\\\n\\\\nRest in peace to a kind, brilliant, and generous soul.

The most notable thing was the 14th century Church.\\n\\nWe then took the train to 'Sheerness' as we had a couple hours to kill; and its the next town on from Queenbourgh. We thought Sheerness would be a nice seaside town. We were very wrong.\\n\\nI thought the 'chav' phase, died in the mid 2000's. But visiting Sheerness was like being transported back in time to the height of chavdom. Entering the train, I was greeted by a group of kids smashing up the train toilet and screaming. They were eventually shouted at by the train warden.\\n\\nLuckily the train journey was only a few minutes, as we got off the train. We emerged into lovely 'Sheerness'.\\n\\nI am really not a particularly well to do person, but looking around at the local inhabitants of sheerness, I felt very uneasy. Coupled with the thick smell of... poo in the air.\\n\\nThe locals genuinely looked like some kind of human experiment gone wrong, men dressed in tracksuits and other sports wear from about 15 years ago. With neck tattoos and plastic jewelry. Extremely skinny looking women covered in tattoos with 5+ children following them, and women with bellies that actually touched the floor, never seen that before outside of my 600lbs life.\\n\\nWe walked past the Aldi and McDonalds toward the 'beach', dodging the rubbish and dog poo on the floor, and avoiding the feral children sprinting around us.\\n\\nAs we got closer to the 'beach' the stench grew stronger, not really sure where it was coming from. I think it may have actually been the people now I think about it. The air was thick with flying bugs, weird little beetle things I have never seen before in Essex. These bugs, were going in my eyes, I was getting them in my mouth, up my nose. The locals seemed immune to them however.\\n\\nThe railings were covered in these bugs, literally every inch of the railings and walls had them on it. Looking across the Thames at Southend in the horizon, I have never in my life thought that Southend... is the place id so much rather be.\\n\\nThe smell was still thick in the air. I walked down a stairway leading off the beach into the high-street. I had to ask some lovely gentleman sitting on the floor to move, so I could get past them. I was called a 'fucking downie melt', for doing so.\\n\\nAnyway, brushed that insult off and continued on my way to the high-street; to find somewhere to have lunch. Stumbled upon a Caf\\u00e9.\\n\\nThe high-street was very derelict looking, Bookies, Corner shops, and this bank brand I have never seen before anywhere else in the UK.\\n\\nThe waitress seemed disappointed to see us, cans of coke were slid to us from across the table. Had to wait 15mins for a melted cheese sandwich, which unfortunately had the same flying bugs from the beach inside it.\\n\\nWe didnt eat much, finished our cokes and went back to the station. I have never left a town in the UK, and genuinely felt a deep sorrow for the people who live there, like I did for the people of sheerness.\\n\\nHalf the train were thrown off by the ticket wardens.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 4745,\n        \"min\": 2927,\n        \"max\": 72360,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 893,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3489\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"comments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"[{'comment_body': \\\"Anyone who thinks we're still at the beginning of the slippery slope is fuckin kidding themselves.

No one would admit that.', 'comment_score': 320}, {'comment_body': 'Javid, Sunak, Zahawi, Kwarteng, Hunt\\u2026 that\\u2019s a list of chancellors who\\u2019ve been ground up and squeezed out of the political mincing machine since 2019 \\u2013 the last four of them in just four months.\\\\n\\\\nAnd with each change, a posse of junior ministers gets dragged out of the Treasury behind them. Chris Philp: gone as chief secretary. Simon Clarke, his predecessor and Steve Barclay before him: both scattered to lesser offices of state. As for the two chief secretaries before them? One was Sunak, the other Liz Truss herself.\\\\n\\\\nSo what we\\u2019re seeing in this crisis is not just the collapse of UK fiscal credibility. It\\u2019s the evisceration of a cadre of Tories capable of doing the job.\\\\n\\\\nAnd there\\u2019s an existential reason why. Each of these politicians has tried to make Brexit work and it will not work. Theresa May tried soft Brexit plus austerity. Boris Johnson tried hard Brexit plus fiscal expansion. Truss tried hard Brexit plus fiscal expansion. As I write this, with the helicopters buzzing over a frenzied Whitehall, only the austerity part is certain. Being chancellor is hard.\\\\n\\\\nBeing chief secretary is even harder, because you\\u2019re the enforcer with your own side: the person whose hand actually signs off public spending, and whose spreadsheets keep the state pension system solvent. So the Tory debacle is systematically scouring out the talent from Britain\\u2019s political class.\\\\n\\\\nYou can wing it as an amateur at Defra. You can Tweet, like home secretary Suella Braverman, sarky comments against police officers trying to do their jobs. Or, like Boris Johnson while PM, you can simply lie. But in monetary and fiscal policy, command of detail and communicative restraint matter, because you are dealing with immovable reality.\\\\n\\\\nTo restore Britain\\u2019s fiscal credibility, the Tories will now be required to do the very thing they don\\u2019t believe in: raise taxes and most probably cut spending massively \\u2013 including on policing and defence.\\\\n\\\\nEven as Hunt delivered his total U-turn, the masthead on the Conservative Party Twitter account said \\u201ccutting taxes is the right thing to do morally and economically\\u201d \\u2013 a direct quote from Truss herself. Conservatism ended up in this moral and economic space because all its other options for making Brexit work were tried.\\\\n\\\\nLess than four weeks ago the Tufton Street gurus of free-market economics were being hailed as visionaries for designing this \\u201claboratory experiment\\u201d in neo-Thatcherism. Now it\\u2019s over, how will Tory finance ministers justify to themselves, their advisers, their civil servants, a programme they do not believe in?\\\\n\\\\nThe magnitude of the Tory debacle, therefore, does not lie simply in the damage it has done to the public finances, or the damage it will bequeath to a Labour government. It lies in the ideological dead end the party has reached.\\\\n\\\\nThe moment has been a long time coming. David Cameron and George Osborne inflicted austerity on a scale that, in its first two years, plunged the economy into stagnation. Only the Bank of England issuing money to the tune of hundreds of billions limited the damage.\\\\n\\\\nJohnson and May, each grappling with the post-Brexit reality of falling trade, flatlining investment, and then Covid-19, ended up borrowing on a massive scale \\u2013 secure in the knowledge that a country with a sovereign currency cannot go bust, and that all other countries were being forced to borrow.\\\\n\\\\nRishi Sunak, like the proverbial dieter bingeing on doughnuts, pledged that once the cravings were over, he too would deliver lower taxes and a smaller state \\u2013 even as he borrowed more in a year than John McDonnell had promised to over five years.\\\\n\\\\nNow the small state is proven a chimera, the Conservatives face a moment of ideological reckoning.\\\\n\\\\nOut of the wreckage of conservatism must now crawl a new cadre of politicians who believe in fiscal realism.\\\\n\\\\nBrexit has created an economy that cannot pay its way. As trade falls on all measures, the current account deficit has ballooned above 8% of GDP. That leaves UK government borrowing reliant \\u2013 as former Bank governor Mark Carney put it \\u2013 on \\u201cthe kindness of strangers\\u201d. Growth is stagnant because investment has stagnated since 2016. And though the pound has lost nearly a third of its value since Brexit, the etiolated structure of the economy means there is no upside in terms of exports.\\\\n\\\\nSo the strategic choice facing those who will pick up the pieces is not small state/big state. It is the reversal of Brexit \\u2013 at least to the extent that we begin to attract long-term business investment; and that our current account deficit reverses; and the government\\u2019s cost of borrowing comes down to sustainable levels.\\\\n\\\\nWhat\\u2019s striking, as we watch the Tories flounder, is how un-conservative they became. The philosopher Michael Oakeshott once defined the conservative ethos as the ability to \\u201ckeep afloat on an even keel\\u2026 seamanship consists in using the resources of a traditional manner of behaviour in order to make a friend of every hostile occasion.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nThe traditional manner of behaviour \\u2013 drilled into every junior official at the Treasury, every economics undergraduate, every nerd in a bow-tie at the Oxford Union \\u2013 is to balance the country\\u2019s books and instil confidence.\\\\n\\\\nInstead \\u2013 to switch metaphors \\u2013 a whole generation of Tories in early middle age have leapt over the parapet of the trench to get mown down by the markets.

Abolish the monarchy and push for sustainable wind farms offshore to power it all.\\\\n\\\\nStop taking the cream of the crop from other countries i.e. Doctors etc from India for example and train people in this country to do the job.

Every day. All day. Its so frustrating trying to communicate with people from countries where they just don\\\\'t give a fuck about anyone.. And they bring their disrespectful attitude here... They hate our country and hate the English in general... I tried I really tried... The last time I went over just to ask if they could be brought inside...

If I was being a cunt in Spain and not respecting the local people or ruining peoples lives then I would expect Spain to chuck me off the resort or back off on a plane...\\\\n\\\\nIt makes me properly sad to see people who just don\\\\'t respect the British way of life. The cordial and mild manner Englishman is something that used to be praised but now we just scream and shout like Americans. There\\\\'s just no class left... People are so empty due to everything being about political standpoints and shit... No one has the balls to suggest that multiculturalism has very little merit when the beliefs/attitudes of those being allowed to live in the UK just fucking hate us anyway... Oh we have it so good, you pos English imperial ass holes etc etc... Well why not try making your own country a less shit hole to live in and fight back against the government there... Guess what... Its too much like hard work. The UK bore democracy and implanted its fair play measure across the world... The only difference is that most brittish people are fair... Mainly foreign governments are massively currupt... After bringing this multicultural madness into the UK... Looks what\\\\'s happening to our politics. Utter shit show... There are too many fucking people to please... Someone must stand up and suggest a different way of doing things because this is not working...\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\'s such a great country regardless of what anyone says.

Brexit was butchered because the politicians couldn\\\\'t be arsed to listen properly to the people and chose to side with those who thought that the EU was the bees knees...

And now you wanna go crawling back to the EU?? Well that will look good won\\\\'t it... You\\\\'re fucking deluded if you think that\\\\'s not exactly what they want...

The main problems with non-article submission vs article submission  are the following\\n\\n1. Overall poor quality post\\n2. Topics are so broad discussion become meaningless\\n3. A poorly researched post can lead to unhinged discussion\\n\\nThese can also happen with article submissions, but are much less likely due to article putting a fence around the discussion, or was written by expert in the field.\\n\\nYou see a lot of uncivil and misinformed comments in an article post, but what you are far less likely to see is whole discussion going down a rabbit hole.\\n\\n**OVERALL POOR QUALITY POST**\\n\\nHere are two post that are of poor quality\\n\\n1. [Questions on the Influence and Role of Overseas Chinese](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/grvynu/questions_on_the_influence_and_role_of_overseas/?sort=new)\\n2. [How does protecting shipping lanes help project power?](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gtbygj/how_does_protecting_shipping_lanes_help_project/)\\n\\nTHe first post isn't a good post, because the OP never specified how relevant it was to geopolitics. Secondly, the responses were very personal.  The second was a bad question, because to be honest the main role of Navy isn't always to protect sea lanes. If you want to project power, you project power.\\n\\n**TOPICS ARE SO BROAD DISCUSSIONS BECOME MEANINGLESS**\\n\\nThis sub has a tendency to think they are smarter than they actually are.  Here is a good example\\n\\n[What role has Islam played in the hindrance of development of most Muslim nations?](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gy548n/what_role_has_islam_played_in_the_hindrance_of/)\\n\\nThe question is so broad that it become meaningless. Furthermore, let be honest here, how many economist would tell a government lets change the religion of a country to see if it boast economic growth?\\n\\nIt is these post that destroy the already low reputation of this sub. It invites a lot of people who are Islamophobes. Secondly, most of the scholars like Huntington who OP mentions don't know much about Islam and aren't economist / sociologist.\\n\\n**POORLY RESEARCHED POST CAN LEAD TO UNHINGED DISCUSSION**\\n\\nOften post are poorly researched, and can lead to people going down a rabbit hole.  This is a good example\\n\\n[Thoughts on the rise of Pan-Anglo-Saxonism and the potential for an unification of the five eyes Anglo countries in the future](https://www.reddit.com/r/geopolitics/comments/gm25l2/thoughts_on_the_rise_of_pananglosaxonism_and_the/),\\n\\nThe OP thought that Pan Anglo-Saxonism was a way to counter Hispanization in the US, and the US would take the lead. The other commentators than resorted to calling his ideas racist. The whole discussion detached from reality, because politicians generally don't use the term Anglo-saxonism.\\n\\nThe proper term is Anglosphere, and most of its leading proponents come from outside the US (ie UK, Canada, Australia). One of the advocates is [Boris Johnson](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/24/boris-johnson-dreams-anglosphere-european-union-empire-colonialism/)\\n\\nThe Anglosphere  isn't racial, but linguistic.

The goal won\\\\'t be to achieve total capitulation - they\\\\'ll accept the minimal concessions that will allow them to say they\\\\'ve reunified the country before October\\\\'s Congress. \\\\n\\\\n* \\\"One China\\\" policy recognizes that Taiwan is part of China. This makes Taiwan\\\\'s coastal waters Chinese waters. So this would not be a clear-cut act of war the way an international blockade would usually be. \\\\n\\\\n* Taiwan imports >80% of their food & fuel. A successful blockade would starve them out well before October (when the seas become too stormy for small littoral vessels). \\\\n\\\\nChina started their \\\"Civil Military Fusion\\\" of merchant vessels in 2014. This encompasses over 1M sailors/fishermen and 172k ships & boats. Xi put himself in personal charge of this effort, which suggests he sees it as being of great strategic importance (reserve forces are typically low priority). \\\\n\\\\nChina has used this \\\"peaceful\\\" approach on a small scale to achieve area denial around contested atolls and fishing grounds. Unarmed Chinese vessels will physically block the path of foreign ships, or surround them and make their passage impossible. \\\\n\\\\nSome other signs: \\\\n\\\\n* PRC passed a law last year requiring all Chinese vessels to stop [broadcasting their positions in Chinese waters](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/24/business/china-shipping-data-mic-intl-hnk/index.html). This allows them to conceal which ships are where to a certain extent (satellite imagery still works of course). \\\\n\\\\n* Fishing boats have been outfitted with devices to increase their radar signature. These are inflatable metal balloons or \\\"pop up\\\" structures. They allow cheap boats to appear to be more significant vessels, to soak up long-range anti-ship missiles. \\\\n\\\\n* China [has hoarded](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-05/one-reason-for-rising-food-prices-chinese-hoarding) a record amount of food stocks. They have over a year\\\\'s supply of most cereals and grains. They are well prepared if the West attempts to cut off their imports. \\\\n\\\\nTheir goal won\\\\'t be to starve Taiwan out - Taiwan will be required to make concessions and then Beijing can directly provide the food and fuel they need. \\\\n\\\\nTaiwan can of course attempt to break the blockade by force, but they have no way to sink tens of thousands of boats. Any attempt to do so will look like an escalation, and China will claim the right to self-defense (some fishing boats can be provided with MANPADS). \\\\n\\\\nThe US Navy is another force that could attempt to break the blockade, so we could see squadrons of F-35\\\\'s attacking fleets of unarmed fishing boats. This will play well for China\\\\'s propaganda campaign. China is not afraid to engage with the USN, but they will only do so in a \\\"self defense\\\" capacity.
